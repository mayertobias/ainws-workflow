18 ContributorsAfter Rain LyricsYou call arrows to fall short
Because the snow is at our feet
And when embraces subside, and the lilies have died
It comes down to her tears on a sheet
But it's alright because
You cause lanterns to light
And force demons disperse
And if Lucifer may fear the swift drying of tears
Then, for evil, you could not be worse
But I see you now, yeah, I see you
And release me now, kinda like dreams do
And I see you now, was hard to see you
Just don't forget to sing
Remember everything
You're the only little girl I know who'd bring a kite in the snow
Said, "You just gonna hold it up?"
Said, "Nah, I'm gonna let it go"
And when your heart hurts, days like today are the antidote
If you think just maybe it's her
Then promise me, young man, you're gonna let her know
You won't go lonely, yeah
You won't go lonely, yeah
You won't go lonely, yeah
You won't go lonely, yeah

It'll all be better in the morning
'Cause while you sleep, I'll build a wall
Pick a weapon up or something
We're 'bout to have ourselves a brawl
In dead of night, one window open
He heard her singing down the hall
Singing 'bout him, least he was hoping
She left her listener enthralled
Woohoo
