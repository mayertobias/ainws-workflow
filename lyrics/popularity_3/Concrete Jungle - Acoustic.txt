Vultures sit on skyscrapers
Watchin' for the ones who fall down first
Everything you want in 24 hours
But nothin' you need
Cracks in the pavement scorpions
Abandoned retail emporiums
Amazon Prime, the new world power
As long as its cheap

We don't get no sleep, no sleep at all
We're nocturnal

In this concrete jungle
We all act like animals
We're runnin' on pure instinct
No we ain't scared of nothin'
In this concrete jungle
We make our homes in city walls
You know we gotta run so wild
To keep up with this life style (In this concrete jungle)

In this wasteland you can die of thirst
Or drown in the lack of your own words
Swimmin' with the sharks in your own bathtub
With money to burn
Wolves at your door, moon in the sky
Last in the food chain, get the lights
It's gonna get dark in nature's night club (Night club)
If we never learn

We don't get no sleep, no sleep at all
We're nocturnal

In this concrete jungle
We all act like animals
We're runnin' on pure instinct
No we ain't scared of nothin' (No)
In this concrete jungle
We make our homes in city walls
You know we gotta run so wild
To keep up with this life style

In this concrete jungle
We all act like animals
We're runnin' on pure instinct
No we ain't scared of nothin'
In this concrete jungle
You know we gotta run so wild
To keep up with this life style
