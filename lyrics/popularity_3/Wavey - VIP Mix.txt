Get high
Get lit
Get drunk
Get wavey
Get wavey (Eski boy)
Get high
Get lit
Get drunk
Get wavey

Listen
Let me tell you like this
I got the vibe that's 'bout to go boom
Never a dull day when Wiley's in the room
Do it for the massive in the summer, like June
If I ever leave, said I'd be back soon
All these waves and I'm the pioneer
I can get a vibe 'round here or 'round there
If you didn't know, man-a-man's gone clear
 x2
Yeah, stamina
Hit a quick a pose for the camera
Why you sittin' down you an amateur
I don't play about
Bring out the next challenger

 x4
Imma make you get
Get high
Get lit
Get drunk
Get wavey
Get wavey

So let me tell you like this
I'm who you're looking for, I'm the wiz
I am the littest girl up in here
Came on my own I buy my own drinks
He wanna take me home oh he wish
Bad gyal inna London
Pure shots turn up with the gang n em
Two two twerk gas up the mandem
Go work at 8 in the morning
 x2
Beat strong
Bassline bumping my feet gone
Out 'ere grinding on people
DJ hit a wheel up for the sequel
 x4
Imma make you get
Get high
Get lit
Get drunk
Get wavey
Get wavey
So let me tell you like this

(The waves is high)
Yo, I make the gyaldem freeze
Do it with ease, dem other man need Ps
Whenever it's me you know she don't wanna leave
Got a hot body looking like a hundred degrees
In school, I never got As and Bs
But Double, I'm troubling any gyal I see
Give her the D, my tank's never on E
I just wanna show you that you're F'ing with a G
I got girls in the North, girls in the South, girls in the East, girls in the West
They only holla cah a brudda looks fresh
And they know with the flows, I'm the best
So someone tell the DJ turn up the speaker
It's Double S for the CLiQ and Alika
Wavey as hell, we be living la vida
From Miami to Ibiza
 x4
Get high
Get lit
Get drunk
Get wavey
Get wavey
