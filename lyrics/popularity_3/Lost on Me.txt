5 ContributorsLost On Me LyricsA new release from Peace’s second upcoming album. The band seem to have gone more “90s boyband-esque” with the video and the beat.
(Ha-ahhh)
I've an empty room, inside it's true, you need no name
Be old and bruised in stolen shoes
You feel the same, baby
Not on what you wear or a length of hair is there ease to define
The cut of your pith, the sound from your lips, it's truly divine

You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

(Ha-ahhh)
I've a royal love for the common blood, let me colour your bones
Sometimes the simplest thing, an elegant sting resounds the most

You're chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

(Get lost on me)
(Get lost on me)
Chemically so heavenly
Never been too far

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me

Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
Get lost on me
(Get lost on me)
I love it when it hits, the lightning from your lips
It's lost on me
