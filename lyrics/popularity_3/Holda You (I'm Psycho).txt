4 ContributorsHolda You (Iâ€™m Psycho) LyricsWhen you see me, you turn away
I can't remember what I wanted to say
I'm quite concerned, I'm going down
I need to face it but I don't know how
Is it gonna last?
Look at yourself
Find some time to tell part of the truth
Oh, I can't wait to get a hold of you
Get a hold of you, get a hold of you
Somewhat suspicious, shaky hands
I get the feeling you've been making other plans
Like a fool, I was misled
Hanging on to little things that you said
Is it gonna last?
Look at yourself
Find some time to tell part of the truth
Oh, I can't wait to get a hold of you
Get a hold of you, get a hold of you
I'm gonna do that walk
Right to your door
I'm not gonna stop
Till you're on the floor

I'm gonna take what's coming
I'm gonna have what's mine
You better call your girlfriend
Gonna run and hide
I'm coming
I'm coming, get ready
I'm coming
I'm gonna have what's mine
You better call your girlfriend
Gonna run and hide
I'm coming, get ready
I'm coming
Ooh
