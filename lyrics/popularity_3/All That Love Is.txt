8 ContributorsAll That Love Is Lyrics
There were holes in the asphalt
So I went outside to take a look
Like the holes in my heart
From all that you took

See 'cause
All that love is
Is a feeling that'll leave you down
All that love's been
Empty corners inside this town
What if I can't make it?
You know I can't fake it
Will I a-a-a-a-always just regret it?
And now, I can't have you
And every second
The memories of our love
Are just feelings that'll leave you down

I looked for ways to forget you
But I'm not sure that there is one
And the harder that I try
The more I come undone

See 'cause
All that love is
Is a feeling that'll leave you down
All that love's been
Empty corners inside this town
What if I can't make it?
You know I can't fake it
Will I a-a-a-a-always just regret it?
And now, I can't have you
And every second
The memories of our love
Are just feelings that'll leave you down
