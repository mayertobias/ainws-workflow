Looking back at yesterday
I thought I gave it everything
But still there's so much road ahead of me
When I looked into your eyes
I guess I didn't recognize
Who we are and all that we can be

Sometimes it's hard to find yourself
But it's worth it in the end
'Cause in your heart is where it all begins

We gotta be bold
We gotta be brave
We gotta be free (Hey)
We gotta get loud
Making that change
You gotta believe (Woah)
We'll look deep inside (Hey)
And we'll rise up and shine
We can be bold
We can be brave
Let everyone see
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me

There's something special that I've learned
It's together we can change the world
Everybody's got something they can bring
When you take a look inside yourself
Do you wish that you were something else?
But who you are is who you need to be

Sometimes it's hard to find yourself
But it's worth it in the end
'Cause in your heart is where it all begins

We gotta be bold
We gotta be brave
We gotta be free (Hey)
We gotta get loud
Making that change
You gotta believe (Woah)
We'll look deep inside (Hey)
And we'll rise up and shine
We can be bold
We can be brave
Let everyone see
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me

If we all can do our part
We know that it can be the start
To bring about the difference that we need (Yeah)
I promise we can work this out
I promise we can see it through
Don't you know it's up to me
It's up to me and you?

We gotta be bold
We gotta be brave
We gotta be free (Gotta be free)
We gotta get loud
Making that change
You gotta believe (Woah)
We'll look deep inside
And we'll rise up and shine (Oh, woah)
We can be bold
We can be brave (We can be brave)
Let everyone see
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me (Woah, woah, hey)
It starts with you and me
