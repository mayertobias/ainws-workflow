You gotta work (Slight work, light work)
D-Town to the DMV (Slight work, Diplo, what's up?)
Work it, work it
Probably got your girl going crazy
Work, wo-wo-work it, oh (Drunk white bitches)
Work it, work it
Work, wo-wo-work ot, oh, oh

I can do it all and it ain't no problem
Ain't nobody harder than that nigga Folarin
Bitch, I go hard, I'm ballin', I'm globetrottin'
And my flow art, my nigga, I'm Mozart with it
As often, I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish, I be on that new shit
And I'm blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition, I ain't even finished college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
Any broad, bet I lay her like I'm dressin' for the fall, nigga
And I'm all that, hit the passenger door
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose
I ain't tryna brag though, I just know I'm that dope
Kick game Bojack, my Bo Jacks Tae Bo
Haha, and it ain't no problem
You race to these broads, I relay and baton 'em
Bitches ain't hearin' one thou'
But when you step out, why these bitches run out?
Double MG shit, I put the set down
Rick James that, bad bitches on the couch
Ah, word play, Olubowale is my first name
I think I'm Koko B. Ware, you just a bird babe
I got a pair of Js, I roll a pair of Js
We up in Diamond Supply, spending that carat cake
Let 'em marinate, you forever late
A million home sellers couldn't find a realer state

It's slight work, it's light work
The wrong drink, the right work
It's slight work, light work
The wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, yeah, let's go (Work it out, work it out, ahhh)

Bitch you ain't a boss 'til you cut a fuckin' paycheck
Only thing between me and your bitch is a latex
Man, and I ain't into saving these hoes (What?)
My nigga, tell me where you see the cape at?
B-I, B-I, bitch, B-I-G (B-I-G)
Two things that I don't need are you and my ID
I'ma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch
Green faces but a nigga dodgin' yellow badges
Woop! (Heheheh)
Cause I'm drunk (Yeah, okay)
Under 25, living the fuckin life
White America said I'd be doing 25 to life
And just for that, I'ma blow 25 tonight (Do it)
You make 25 a year, I make 25 a night, whoa!
Blocka, blocka, blocka (Blocka)
Bitch get hit with my CÃ®roc-a vodka chopper (Go)
Taking body shots: blocka, blocka, blocka (Whoa)
Probably in your girl's dreams, probably in your daughter locker
Top floor like I'm out tanning (Whoa)
And they stoled your whole delivery, now that's outlandish
I guess like the delivery man, I'm outstanding
Car tinted, I'm in that tint like I'm out camping
God damn it, I'm one hell of a guy
Looking down on a cloud, that's a hell of a high
Bitch, I gets ghost, the way she screaming "Big"
Niggas couldn't tell if I was dead or alive

It's slight work, it's light work
The wrong drink, the right work
It's slight work, light work
The wrong drink, the right work
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, work
(Work it out, work it out, work it out, don't stop)
Work, work, work, yeah, go (Work it out, work it out, ahhh)

Man, you already know (Uh)
Finally Famous in this, gettin' (Slight work, light work)
Maybach! (Slight work, light work)
Slight work, light work (G.O.O.D, boi)
Slight work, light work (Boi, gotta work)
Slight work, light work
D-Town to the DMV (Slight work)
Probably got your girl going crazy (Stupid)
Crazy (Boi, haha) boi, boi (Uh, uh)
Slight work, light work, slight work
From the D-Town to the DMV
I got all these bad bitches tryna get with me, uh
Yeah, from the D-Town to the DMV (You gotta work)
Got all these bad bitches tryna get on me, uh
Haha, we need to see ID
