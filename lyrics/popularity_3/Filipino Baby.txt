3 ContributorsFilipino Baby LyricsWhen the warship's left Manila sailing proudly o'er the sea
All the sailors hearts were filled with fond regret
Looking backward to this Island where they spent such happy hours
Making love to every pretty girl they've met
(Well up stopped a little sailor with his pride eyes all aglow
Saying take a look at my girl's photograph)
Then the sailors gathered round him just to look upon her face
And he said I love my Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my trasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby
In a little rustic cottage in the port of Philippines dwells a lonely little maiden all alone
(She is thinking of her true love though he's far across the sea
And her heart beats true for him and him alone)
Then one day he whispered darling I've come back from Caroline
I've come back to claim the only girl I love
And that night there was a wedding while the ships crew gathered round
And he wed his little Filipino baby
She's my Filipino baby she's my treasure and my pet
Her teeth are bright and pearly and her hair is black as jet
Oh her lips are sweet as honey and her heart is true I know
She's my darling my little Filipino baby
