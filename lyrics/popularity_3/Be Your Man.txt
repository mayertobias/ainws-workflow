10 ContributorsI Want To Be Your Man Lyrics
Hey lady, let me tell you why
I can't live my life without you (Aw baby)
Every time I see you walkin' by, I get a thrill
You don't understand but in time you will

I must make you understand

I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes I do, yeah-yeah)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)

Better not pass me by, 'cause if you do you'll
Lose a good thing (Oh baby)
'Cause what I got to say is sealed with a kiss
And a wedding ring (Wedding ring)

My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view

I must make you understand

I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes I do, yeah-yeah)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)

Words can never say what I feel
It's too intense (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried
I've tried to tell you how I feel
But I get mixed up (So mixed up)

My mind is blind at times
I can't see anyone but you
Those other girls don't matter
No, they can't spoil my view

I must make you understand

I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes I do, yeah-yeah)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes I do)
I want to be your man
I want to be your man (Wanna be your man)
I want to be your man (Yes I do, yeah-yeah)
I want to be your man (I wanna be your man)
