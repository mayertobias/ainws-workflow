2 ContributorsAnytime, Anyplace, Anywhere (Remastered) Lyrics
Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhere
Just say the word, you'll be here
Yes, I'll be there
It makes no difference
How you leave me
I'll be right here if you need me
Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhere

Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhere
I love you dear
Though not around you may be
Can't you see you were meant for me?
And that's the way it's gonna bе
Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhеre

Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhere
Don't leave me dear
Because your place is right here
Oh, I'll always, always, always be true
Yes, I'll always go on loving you
Well, anytime, anyplace, anywhere
