4 ContributorsHolding Her and Loving You Lyrics
It's the third hardest thing I'll ever do
Leavin' here without you
And the second hardest thing I'll ever do
Is tellin' her about you

She's been good to me when things were goin' rough
How can I tell her now, that good ain't good enough
Oh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you

If she'd give me one good reason I'd be gone
But she ain't done, one thing wrong
So don't expect me to just walk out of the door
I still love her, but I love you more

She's been good to me when things weren't goin' right
She made my days long before you made my nights
So, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you


Yeah, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you
Girl, the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
Is holdin' her and lovin' you
