(The, the, the, the, the, the)

The flower's pink on the tree
But if you pick it to see
Will it be wild and free?
You say you wanted a piece
Is it for sale or for lease?
Oh, that's the easy police
(Come on down)
Outside the world within ya
Bend to the Woolf Virginia
Take to the bridge that's under
Hunt for the sun to wonder
What you wanna do today?
I'm your favorite kid, let's play
Dedicated to the ones we serve
She's so full of learning curves
I, oh, I

Shе's a lover
She's a lover
Shе's a lover
She's a lover

Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief
I, oh, I

And when I'm fallin' asleep
Please give me somethin' to keep
Me warm and kind of complete
Long time to go without ya
Try slow to know about ya
For now is my better
Less time in forever
Please, love, can I have a taste?
I just wanna lick your face
Any other day and I would say
You're Atlantis manta ray

She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover
She's a lover, unlimited love again
Gotta love her, unlimited love again
She's a lover, unlimited love again
Little lover, unlimited love again

Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief

(Look at you)


Love me, love me
Wake up and hug me
I will be a torrid beast
Well, if you need me, need me
Wake up and squeeze me
Nothin' but a sweet relief

Nothin' but a sweet relief
I will be a torrid beast
I will be a torrid beast
I will be a torrid beast
