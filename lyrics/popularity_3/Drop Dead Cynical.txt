15 ContributorsDrop Dead Cynical Lyrics
Drop-dead cynical

I need attention, feed on my addiction
I want the action, satisfaction
You have to feed me words that I inquire
So my discord someday takes me higher

I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth: you are drop-dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop-dead cynical
Drop-dead cynical

It's your illusion's fatal contradiction
I need the action, premonition
I like to thrill you, I am what inspires
Let you explode in a cosmic fire

You're Diogenes, enlightened Zeno's mind
Ten times a cynic as the man behind the shine
You make it hard to justify it all
See what you are: you are drop-dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop-dead cynical
Drop dead cynical
Drop dead cynical

Drop dead cynical
Drop dead cynical

I hope to thrill you, let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth: you are drop-dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates of paradise
Let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes and soon we're all
We're drop-dead cynical
