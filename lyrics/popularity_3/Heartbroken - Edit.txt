2 ContributorsHeartbroken  Lyrics
Sitting here at home
Thinkin bout you all alone
Wonder where I all went wrong
Got a confession to make...
Since you made me happier
Now all I can do is hurt
When you left you took my heart
Got a confession to make...
{Chorus x4}

I'm heartbroken (without your love)
I'm heartbroken (yes, I've had enough)
I'm heartbroken
I don't know what to say
I've never felt this way

We had something so true
I realised I meant nothing to you
I guess you thought I was your fool
Got a confession to make...
Now I realise the truth
I don't want anything to do with you
It's just the way I was attracted to you
Got a confession to make...

{Chorus x4}
