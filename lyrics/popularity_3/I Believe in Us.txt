Lately I've been dreaming of a life
Told myself that there was only one
Maybe I've been holding on too tight
Hard to see what you and I'd become

Happy, are you happy?
Are you even close?
If you ever ask me
Aren't I supposed to know

Cause I've been dreaming that you love me in the morning
Love me when the morning comes
I've been dreaming that you love me when the fighting
Love me when the fighting's done
Oh, my love
Don´t cry, love
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us

Lately I've been dreaming of a life
Thinking I was taking on your name
Do I have to put that dream on ice?
Leave it there, and wait for it to break

What is it I'm seeing?
Boy is that defeat
Words can be deceiving
Baby look at me

Cause I've been dreaming that you love me in the morning
Love me when the morning comes
I've been dreaming that you love me when the fighting
Love me when the fighting's done
Oh, my love
Don´t cry, love
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us

Oh, baby you break me
Oh, that's why I keep leaving
Happy, are you happy?

Cause I've been dreaming that you love me in the morning
Love me when the morning comes
I've been dreaming that you love me when the fighting
Love me when the fighting's done
Oh, my love
Don´t cry, love
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us
I believe in us
