Watch me run, watch me run away
Got no ties left to yesterday
I know who I was, put me here now
I got no intention to slow down
Burn my past in the fireplace
From the ashes, I rise again
Looking at the future, it's so bright
I'm gonna make it mine, gonna make it mine

Show you how I do
Out here making these moves
Ain't here to play

You ain't ready for it
Watch me go, watch me go rule the world
Know you never doubted, baby
I'ma go run the whole universe
Baby, I was born to rule
Yeah, I'm the queen, I'm the queen
And it's all because of you
That I'm the queen of hearts

See it clear as day, dreaming 'bout the way
One day, I would rule the world
Now that I'm surrounded by all my girls
We be shining bright like diamonds and pearls (Hey, hey, hey)
You all made it like a movement, yeah
Take a bow up on the stage
All my friends know how to do it
And you can do it too, just follow, hey
You're making me shine today (Yeah, you can do it, hey)
Yeah, I do this everyday, oh

Show you how I do
Out here making these moves
Ain't here to play

You ain't ready for it
Watch me go, watch me go rule the world
Know you never doubted, baby
I'ma go run the whole universe
Baby, I was born to rule
Yeah I'm the queen, I'm the queen
And it's all because of you
That I'm the queen of hearts

Screaming out my name, see it in the stage lights
Feel so lucky just to have ya, ah
'Cause I know deep down
I was meant for something bigger, greater (Bigger, greater)
I know you're seeing what I see (See what I see)
Yeah, I'll be everything you need
I know I'm gonna walk the walk and talk the talk to be

There can only be one (Oh-oh, oh)

You ain't ready for it
Watch me go, watch me go rule the world (Woah, rule the world)
Know you never doubted, baby
I'ma go run the whole universe
Baby, I was born to rule
Yeah I'm the queen, I'm the queen
And it's all because of you
That I'm the queen of hearts (Hearts)

So thank you for the memories (Memories)
You're all the ones who made me (Made me)
So thank you for the memories
That I'm the queen of hearts
