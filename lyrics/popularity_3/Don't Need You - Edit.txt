1 ContributorDonâ€™t Need You (Promo Only clean edit) LyricsThey always warned
Don't get caught up you'll just get burned
The storm has come
To crumble my world to the ground
Now I'm cutting myself off
Am I really done with you?
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
We breathe as one
We feed the fiend that I've become
This is so hard
You help me cover all my scars
But now I'm cutting myself off
Am I really done with you?
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore

Someday... we'll see a better, stronger me
Once I get the fuck away from, the fuck away from you
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't need you anymore
