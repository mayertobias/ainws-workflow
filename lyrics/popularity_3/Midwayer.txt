1 ContributorFacetime LyricsWhole lotta gucci yeah it’s gucci on my waist line
You rlly hatin but yo shawty on ft
I spent bout 60 on my wrist so i don’t waste time
Ik u mad i got sum baddies but can’t take mine
Don’t drink a 40 hold a 40 on my waist line
Said u busy for the smoke u better make time
Know i’m standing at yo home ain’t inna baseline
U rlly hatin but yo shawty on ft

You catchin me sprayin
And me debating
On who to shoot, up at out the roof
We fornicatin
Life is amazin
Rlly amazin
Ain’t even drankin, but with the lean i’m rlly straining
Rlly strainin wit this cup
Right before i got hiccups man
Lambo on pickup
Met yo shawty in the club man
Hatin i mix up
Well how bout u fill me up then
Tellin her cheer up
Cuz the gang could just switch up man

Do not disturb she steady textin me
Ik she messing wit my head and that is mentally
I’m rlly focused on this bag i see the jealousy
Ik you broke you undergoin a vasectomy
She tryna kick it i said no but that’s a penalty
They always see me wit a mic mr kennedy
I dropped a coupe, on my wrist, before 17
They sleepin on me like they watchin documentaries

We was outside we disregarded
Skrt off the lot yk what this car did
My diamonds dancin yea they goin retarted
Whole lotta hunnids like a class fulla smart kids
Run in ya home , ye ya know we bombarded
Makin heat i told the boul to restart it
Left inna space coupe, yea we don’t departed
Ik yo boyfriend took you shoppin at target
Whole lotta gucci yeah it’s gucci on my waist line
You rlly hatin but yo shawty on ft
I spent bout 60 on my wrist so i don’t waste time
Ik u mad i got sum baddies but can’t take mine

Don’t drink a 40 hold a 40 on my waist line
Said u busy for the smoke u better make time
Know i’m standing at yo home ain’t inna baseline
U rlly hatin but yo shawty on ft
