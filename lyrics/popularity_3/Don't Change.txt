All night, all night
You've been in your mind
We were supposed to be leavin'
But you keep overthinkin'
Everything you try
Try on's not right
One doubt, then another
Another somethin' to cover

You're in the mirror, but you're not seeing yourself
Just seein' all the ways you could be someone else
I know you feel sometimes like you're not good enough
You're not the only one

All I'm tryna say is don't change
Every part of you is just right, don't change
Not a single curve or one line
So why cover up your flaws
When they make you who you are? (Oh-oh)
All I'm tryna say is don't change (Ooh)
Don't change (Ooh)

It's hard, it's hard
When you're in the dark
Tryna see things clearly
Yeah, I felt how you're feelin'
All of the stress, pressure
All in pursuit of perfection
Wish you knew that imperfections
Make you an exception

You're in the mirror, but you're not seein' yourself (Not seeing yourself)
Just seein' all the ways you could be someone else
I know you feel sometimes like you're not good enough (Oh)
You're not the only one

All I'm tryna say is don't change
Every part of you is just right, don't change
Not a single curve or one line
So why cover up your flaws
When they make you who you are? (Oh-oh)
All I'm tryna say is don't change (Ooh)
Don't change (Ooh)
No, no, no

No, not one thing
No, not one thing (Not one thing)
Every part about you is as it should be (Woah-oh)
No, not one thing
No, not one thing (No, not one thing)
Every part about you is as it should be

Don't change
Every part of you is just right, don't change
Not a single curve or one line
So why cover up your flaws
When they make you who you are? (Oh-oh)
All I'm tryna say is don't change
