Oh, for all we know
Oh, the world is trying to show us where we first went wrong
And it's a crime if we don't
Be with the one weâ€™ve needed all along

'Round and 'round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
Oh, I can't be without
My love that I have found

Ooh
Oh, for all that we know
Oh, the heart is pumping rhythms that are not our own
Oh, but for all
Oh, you spin me 'round

'Round and 'round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
Oh, I can't be without
My love that I have found

Ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh

'Round and 'round
Had ups and downs
No, but I can't be without
My love that I have found
Oh, when it fits
It should stay like this
Oh, I can't be without
My love that I have found

No no
No no, no no no no no
Oh, I can't be, I can't be without the love that I found
No no
No no, no no no no no

Ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh ooh
