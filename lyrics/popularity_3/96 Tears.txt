But I don't see you wavin' now

I'm way down here wonderin' how
I'm gonna get you, but I know now
I'll just cry

I'll just cry
Too many teardrops
For one heart to be cryin'
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry 96 tears
You're gonna cry, cry cry cry, now
You're gonna cry, cry cry cry
96 tears, c'mon, let me hear you cry, now
96 tears, woo, I wanna hear you cry
Night and day, yeah, all night long
96 tears, cry cry cry
C'mon baby, let me hear you cry now
All night long, 96 tears
Yeah, c'mon now, 96 tears
