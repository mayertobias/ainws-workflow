2 ContributorsBest Part Of us Lyrics
It's been a while, since the storm baby
It's been a while since I fell apart
And I did my best to, walk away but
This moonlit night keeps my head lost
Now watching you from far ain't easy
One by one you stick needles to the heart
To my heart

I know, our love will never make it back home
Watch us drift and grow
I'm guessing that it's best to let go
But I’ll always miss the best part of us
Best part of us
I’ll always miss the best part of us
Best part of us

Was it loneliness or insanity?
I fucked up our possibilities
We may move on, into another dream
But a youthful love is hard to redeem
I know that time will mend these scars but
How I wish I could go back to the start
To the start

I know, our love will never make it back home
Watch us drift and grow
I'm guessing that it's best to let go
I know, our love will never make it back home
Watch us drift and grow
I'm guessing that it's best to let go
But I’ll always miss the best part of us
Best part of us
I’ll always miss the best part of us
Best part of us
