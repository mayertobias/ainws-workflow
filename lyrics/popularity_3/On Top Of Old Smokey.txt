3 ContributorsOn Top of Old Smokey LyricsOn top of Old Smokey, all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for courting too slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting's a grief
And a false-hearted lover is worse than a thief
For a thief will just rob you and take all you save
But a false-hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred a poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies
So come all you maidens and listen to me:
Never place your affections on a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die
You'll all be forsaken and never know why
