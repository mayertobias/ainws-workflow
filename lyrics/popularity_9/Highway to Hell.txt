I'm on the highway to Hell

I'm on the highway to Hell

Don't stop me
Hey, hey, ooh


I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
I'm on the highway to Hell
On the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) I'm on the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) Highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell) I'm on the highway to Hell
(Highway to Hell)

And I'm goin' down
All the way, woah!
I'm on the highway to Hell
