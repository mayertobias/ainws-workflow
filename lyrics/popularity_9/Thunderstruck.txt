I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turnin' back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, "What could I do?" (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beatin' in my heart
The thunder of guns, yeah, tore me apart

You've been
Thunderstruck
Went down the highway, broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah, yeah, they, they, they blew our minds

And I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind

You've been
Thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Ooh, thunderstruck
Yeah

I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again, please? Yow


Ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

Ooh, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Said, yeah, it's all right
We're doin' fine
Yeah, it's all right
We're doin' fine, so fine

Thunderstruck
Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck
Thunderstruck (Thunderstruck)
Whoa, baby, baby (Thunderstruck)
You've been thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Thunderstruck
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) You've been thunderstruck
