There’s no one else around
I just wanna tease your eyes
Maybe we can check these locks
I just wanna go inside

Save yourself tonight

You send my life
Into somewhere I can't describe
So many details
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
