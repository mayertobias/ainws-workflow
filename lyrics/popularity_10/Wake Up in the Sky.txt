Fly-y-y, fly-y-y, fly
It's Gucci (It's Gucci), huh?
Fly (Woo)

I drink 'til I'm drunk (Yeah), smoke 'til I'm high (Yeah)
Castle on the hill (Well damn), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love luxury (Huh)
That's why they all fuck with me (Woo)
Out here with the moves (Moves) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly

Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (Woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, think it's vegetables
Ooh, think it's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond No. 9 now
Section full of fine dimes
Bitches starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable (Woo), like Nat King Cole (Huh)
Gucci Barry White, I'm singing to your ho (Well damn)
A one man show (Whoa), a human bankroll (Whoa)
She lost in the sauce (Woo) 'cause Gucci got the glow (Huh)

I drink 'til I'm drunk (Burr), smoke 'til I'm high (It's Gucci)
Castle on the hill (Huh), wake up in the sky (Yeah)
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love luxury, that's why they all fuck with me
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)

Now watch me fly (Fly-y-y)
Now watch me fly (Fly-y-y)
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly

Kodak, Kodak
I'm so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I'm smokin' this cherry pie so much but this my life
I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tech when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop fifty-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak, take a pic
I came home and dropped a hit
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled (Woo)
Cutlass sittin' high (Yeah), I feel like I can fly (Yeah)
So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing (Glee)

I drink 'til I'm drunk ('Til I'm drunk), smoke 'til I'm high ('Til I'm high)
Castle on the hill (Ayy), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I ain't fly, baby)
I know I'm super fly (I know it), I know I'm super fly (I know it)
The ladies love luxury (Right), that's why they all fuck with me (Ayy)
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth (Yeah, yeah)
You can't tell me I ain't fly (You can't tell me I don't fly, baby)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)

Now, now watch me fly (Fly-y-y)
