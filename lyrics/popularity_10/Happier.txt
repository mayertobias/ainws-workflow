Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes, when we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind, not the fire that we begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened, I think that we both know the way that this story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind 'cause
This just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls and I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else, well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now, if we jump together, at least we can swim far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind 'cause
This just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile, but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind 'cause
This just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I been, I been thinkin'
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
