25 ContributorsYAKWTFGO Lyrics
Pfff, bitch, bitch, bitch
Who want all legit?
Give me all the bags, give me all the bags, give me all the bags
Uh

I'm in Gucci shoes, I’m in G-Star pants
Soon as this shit's out, I'ma need a new advance
I just came from London, but I’ve never been to France
I love the money more than romance
I like to fuck my niggas on cam'
Like damn, popping that ass on the 'Gram, popping it on a handstand
He like my booty 'cause it's not enhanced
He said the real shit is back in demand
I had to take me a break, hold up, wait, boss up on niggas again (Ooh)
Bring my jewelry in the pool (Ooh), 'case I wanna keep it cool

I don't think you wanna know about me
'Cause that’s always bound to start a problem
And the chances are that you can’t solve it
I just really don't think that you wanna know about me
I don’t think you wanna know about me
I got what you need, I'll show you something
And you'll wonder how you lived without it
I just really don't think that you wanna know about me

I put his ass in rotation, I got plenty fish to replace him
If his money ain’t adding up then I get him out the equation (I don't think you wanna know 'bout me)
It's not safe to give the location, this that gang green, gang green
But I like living where's it's Caucasian (I don't think you wanna know 'bout me)
'Cause I'm running out of my patience
Know my hype man is so Haitian
He gon' let it blow 'til it's blazin' (I don't think you wanna know about me)
This that no clothes in my trap house
This that dude rag with that flap out
Bet my young bitch make you tap out

I don't think you wanna know about me
'Cause that's always bound to start a problem
And the chances are that you can't solve it
I just really don't think that you wanna know about me
I don't think you wanna know about me
I got what you need, I'll show you something
And you'll wonder how you lived without it
I just really don't think that you wanna know about me
