2 ContributorsDon’t Werk Lyrics
(Here we go) Tal vez no ves correcto
(Yeah) Puedes esperar un poco más de tiempo
(Yeah) Tal vez no tengo un aventón
(Yeah) Tal vez estoy hablando antes de tiempo
(Here we go) Yeah, dale, go, yeah
Tu quieres excusarme y yo quiero diversión
Yeah, dale, go, yeah
Solo discusión es puta quieres nada son

(Woo, woo)
Yeah, that shit's tirеd, baby, yeah, that shit don't work
Yeah, that shit's tired, baby, pay up
Yеah, that shit's tired, baby, yeah, that shit don't work

(Here we go) Maybe it's the wrong time
(Yeah) Maybe you could wait just a little while longer
(Woo) Maybe I don't have a ride
(Yeah) Maybe I'm just spinning all this out
(Here we go) Yeah, dale, go, yeah
You wanna be serious and I'm all fun
Yeah, dale, go, yeah
I don't wanna fight, bitch, I just wanna fuck

Yeah, that shit's tired, baby, yeah, that shit don't work
Yeah, that shit's tired, baby, pay up
Yeah, that shit's tired, baby, yeah, that shit don't work

Yeah, dale, go, yeah
Yeah, dale, go, yeah
