I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be? (I'm alright)
I'm alright
Don't nobody worry 'bout me
You got to gimme a fight?
Why don't you just let me be?

Do what you like
Doin' it naturally
But if it's too easy
They're gonna disagree
It's your life
And isn't it a mystery?
If it's nobody's business
It's everybody's game

Got to catch you later
No, now, can you pull it right away?
Some Cinderella kid
Get it up and get you a job
(Dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip)

I'm alright
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be? (I'm alright)
I'm alright (Alright, alright)
Don't nobody worry 'bout me (Don't nobody worry 'bout)
You got to gimme a fight? (I don't wanna fight here)
Why don't you just let me be?

Who do you want?
Well, who you gonna be today?
And who is it really
Making up your mind? (Making up your mind?)
You wanna listen to the man?
Pay attention to the magistrate
And while I got you in the mood
Listen to your own heart beatin' (Every day, your heart needs you)
Own heart beatin' (Every day and night)
Own heart beatin' (Every day, your heart needs you)
Own heart beatin' (Every day, night)

Don't it get ya movin'?
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-man, it makes me feel good
Wow, Cinderella kid
So keep it up and get me the job
(Dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip-dip)
I'm (Boom, boom, boom)

I'm alright (I'm alright)
Nobody worry 'bout me (Don't fight, alright)
Why you got to gimme a fight? (Why do you?)
Can't you just let it be? (Oh, be the ball, be the ball)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
Don't nobody worry 'bout me (Don't nobody worry 'bout)
You got to gimme a fight? (Why you wanna fight?)
Why don't you just let me be? (Won't you just let me?)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
Nobody worry 'bout me
Why you got to gimme a fight?
Can't you just let it be?

I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
I'm alright (I'm alright)
Just let me be
I'm alright (Oh, I'm alright)
I'm alright, ooh
I'm alright (Yow, baby)
Just let me be (Everybody let me be)
Ow
