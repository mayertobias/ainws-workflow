1 ContributorDinero - English Version Lyrics
If you got the dinero
Ah, I got my Camaro
Just flash some cash
Buy some gas
Off we'll go

Bring all of your pesos
I'll supply all the besos
Buy some cerveza
Ride up the mesa
Watch the sun go down

If you got the dinero
Ah, I got my Camaro
Just flash some cash
Buy some gas
Off we'll go


If you got the dinero
Ah, I got my Camaro
Just flash some cash
We'll buy some gas
Off we'll go

If you got the dinero
I'll put on my sombrero
We'll go to Yoakum and Cuero
Down to Laredo
Have a good time

If you got the dinero
Ah, I got my Camaro
Just flash some cash
We'll buy some gas
Off we'll go
