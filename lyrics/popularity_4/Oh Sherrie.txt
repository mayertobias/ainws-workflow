You should've been gone
Knowing how I made you feel
And I should've been gone
After all your words of steel

Oh, I must have been a dreamer
(Must have been a dreamer, oh-oh)
And I must've been someone else
(Someone else)
And we should've been over
(Over by now)

Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on

But I want to let go
You'll go on hurtin' me

If I'm not who you thought I'd be

But you know that there's a fever
(There's a fever, oh-oh)
That you'll never find nowhere else
(Nowhere, nowhere else)
Can't you feel it burnin' on and on?

Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie

Long ago, far away
And you should've been gone
Now, I know you'd lie, you'll stay

Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on
Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on

Oh, Sherrie, (Our love) our love holds on, holds on
(Oh, Sherrie, our love, Sherrie, Sherrie)
Hold on
Oh, Sherrie
