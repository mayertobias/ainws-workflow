I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
I'm just out to find
The better part of me

I'm more than a bird, I'm more than a plane
I'm more than some pretty face beside a train
And it's not easy to be me

Find a way to lie
'Bout a home I'll never see

It may sound absurd, but don't be naive
Even heroes have the right to bleed

Well, it's alright
You can all sleep sound tonight
I'm not crazy or anything

I can't stand to fly
I'm not that naive
Men weren't meant to ride
With clouds between their knees

I'm only a man in a silly red sheet
Diggin' for kryptonite on this one-way street
Only a man in a funny red sheet
Lookin' for special things inside of me

Inside of me

Inside of me
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
I'm only a man lookin' for a dream
I'm only a man in a funny red sheet
And it's not easy, hoo, hoo, hoo
It's not easy to be me
