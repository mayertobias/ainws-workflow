4 ContributorsSunny Daze Lyrics
You remind me of a sunny day
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)
You remind me of a sunny day (uh, yeah
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)
{Verse 1]
Nah stop that why all the crying baby we grown up
Look at you baby you shinin' baby you glowed up
Like I was alone happy you showed up
Real shit and I stuck around because you showed love
Told you, you gonna be there that's when I make it
Rare shit, littlest chance you gonna take shit
Late night telling me Teno you gone make it
And not until today did it make sense

You remind me of a sunny day
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)
You remind me of a sunny day (uh, yeah
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)

Like I have to switch the vibe tonight
Cause' lately I been feeling right
Working with T niggas was hatin'
Steady a curse steady narrating
Yeah, we from the west we was YKK
 just tryna make it
We love music that's why we make it
And they can't relate so it don't make sense

You remind me of a sunny day
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)
You remind me of a sunny day (uh, yeah
You remind me of a sunny day (yeah, wha)
