I wish living life was easy (Mhm)
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons (Mhm)

Are we alive? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Or are we dreaming? (Darker days, brighter endings)
After the ride
Are you leaving? (Darker days, brighter endings)
Yeah

Eyes closed, eyes closed (Vertigo)

Eyes closed, eyes closed

Eyes low, eyes low

Eyes closed, eyes closed
I've been falling with my
Eyes low, eyes low
I've been falling with my
