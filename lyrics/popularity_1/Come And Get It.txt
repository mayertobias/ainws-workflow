8 ContributorsCome and Get It Lyrics
BandPlay
Following somebody else's path and doing the same shit they're doing, the same style they're doing it, that ain't fuckin' legendary
BandPlay, BandPlay, BandPlay, BandPlay
Breaking off and making your own path and your own style and doing shit your way, that's fuckin' legendary son
Ha ha ha ha

I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow

La-lately I've been hearin' rumors, oh Upchurch got his ass kicked
Well that's funny, 'cause I didn't feel it and I ain't seen no video yet
Sounds like somebody needs publicity
I don't let these bitch boys get to me
Do you know who I am? I'm Mr. Tennessee
Who the fuck are you? I forgot instantly
I got a four speed Ford, couple bucks to my name
I don't care about money, put some 'spect on my name
I put fire in the game while I spits blue flame
I don't care about these boys if they ridin' in my lane
Yeah, I'm here with a machete and ready to slit throats
Smokin' dope while I'm droppin' you out of my bass boat
Concrete around your feet, motherfucker now float
Go swim with the fish like you work at Bass Pro
(Work at Bass Pro, work at Bass Pro, work at Bass Pro)

Back here in the sticks
Back here in the sticks
You can come and get it
Come and get it son
Back here in the sticks
Pow pow pow pow pow pow
Back here in the sticks
Back here in the sticks

I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow

Fuck tellin' folks about your big truck
Fuck claimin' all you do is fish and hunt
Fuck chuggin' beer in your music video
'Cause you think that gets you credit son
Ever since the Robertson's got a TV show
Everybody "Hell yeahin'" with their camo on
And you ain't real apparently if you don't jam to them old songs
Half y'all punks never heard of John Denver
Old Country Road on a different level
Everybody got a this, everybody got a that
Blah blah blah blah 'bout your John Deere hat
I don't care about no fashion statement
These bare feet used to run the pavement
I'd been known about fuckin' years ago
But I didn't care to go video tape it
Got a lot of honkies runnin' on my team (Team)
Shit look like a Donald Trump regime ('Gime)
Bitch, I'll run you over, where's the key?
I am here to stay, I will not leave
I am in a place you cannot see
Deep in Dixieland between the trees
Steady laughin' at you wannabees (Bees)
And if you really wanna fuck with me

I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
I stay in the sticks with the hicks and the firearms
You might come up missin' from the hogs on my pop's farm
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
You can come and get it, come and get it son, pow pow
