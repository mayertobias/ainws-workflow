5 ContributorsFall in Deep Lyrics
You know me, I know you
And I wish you could tell me what to do
My dark side wanna get loose
So won't you look behind the scenes and get the groove

I fool myself
Keep on running around
Beneath the haze of Love
I leave the ground

Let me fall
Let me fall
Let me fall me fall in deep
Let me get back somewhere
I never sleep

You seem not to feel blue
You're like a fish in there, no one can catch you
This town ain't no peace for me
And i will be gone when you get to me, when you follow my lead

I fool myslef
Keep on running around
Beneath the haze of Love
I leave the ground

Let me fall
Let me fall
Let me fall me fall in deep
Let me get back somewhere
I never sleep
Let me fall
Let me fall
Let me fall me fall in deep
Let me get back somewhere
I never sleep
