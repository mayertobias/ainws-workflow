Yeah, I can't see where you comin' from
But I know just what you runnin' from
And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest," but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, when you're

Feelin' like you're feelin' now
And doin' things just to please your crowd
When I love you like the way I love you
And I suffer but I ain't gonna cut you 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home

Every time I close my eyes
I think, I think 'bout you inside
And your mother, givin' up on askin' why
Why you lie, and you cheat, and you try to make a fool outta she...

And what matters ain't the "Who's baddest," but the
Ones who stop you fallin' from your ladder, 'cause

This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
This ain't no place for no hero
This ain't no place for no better man
This ain't no place for no hero
To call home
