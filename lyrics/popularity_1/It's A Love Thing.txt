7 ContributorsItâ€™s a Love Thing Lyrics
You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Had many ladies, but nothin' can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walk you down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl, a jaw dropper
I could see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know who's jayin' it?
Uh, how lucky are we? Catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves, make this work
The only thing you fear in life is being hurt
But I'm here to protect you, thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you, you can trust me

You and I is bona fide (It's bona fide)
Can't explain the way I feel inside (It's so deep)
I got your back and you got mine (I got your back)
We in this for life, yeah (We in this for life)
You and I is bona fide (We the truth)
I'm down for life and by your side (I'm by your side, baby)
And anything for you is anything for me
It's a love thing, baby

You and I, now that's a hot couple
Put us both in the same club, now you askin' nothin' but trouble
Watch 'em jumpin' outta Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laid back in awe
Surrounded by the gangsters, puffin' on a cigar
Baddest chick in the world keep niggas tranked
Yes, the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked, uh
The question is can you top that, homie?
You can probably pull somethin' close but stop that, homie
Not even, couldn't have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost'll be pokin' her still
Read my will, my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love you're made for a thug
Once I settle in, you made me a gentleman

You and I is bona fide (It's bona fide)
Can't explain the way I feel inside (It's so deep)
I got your back and you got mine (I got your back)
We in this for life, yeah (We in this for life)
You and I is bona fide (We the truth)
I'm down for life and by your side (I'm by your side, baby)
And anything for you is anything for me
It's a love thing, baby

Tote game is crazy, diamonds on stilettos
Travel through these ghettos, drop the top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with, came to win
How the don keeps you fond to blow in the wind
Hump war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen stripe suit
Your hair up in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
Uh, they say a woman's never satisfied
'Til she have me to fill her to her heart's content
It's my blessin', God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all call you C.L.'s wife?
'Cause all we got is each other, a bond for life, uh

You and I is bona fide (It's bona fide)
Can't explain the way I feel inside (It's so deep)
I got your back and you got mine (I got your back)
We in this for life, yeah (We in this for life)
You and I is bona fide (We the truth)
I'm down for life and by your side (I'm by your side, baby)
And anything for you is anything for me
It's a love thing, baby

Uh, it's a love thing, baby, yeah
Uh-huh, 'cause I got you, babe
And I love you, babe
Said that it's a love thing, yeah
It's a love thing, yeah
It's a love thing, baby

You and I is bona fide (It's bona fide)
Can't explain the way I feel inside (It's so deep)
I got your back and you got mine (I got your back)
We in this for life, yeah (We in this for life)
You and I is bona fide (We the truth)
I'm down for life and by your side (I'm by your side, baby)
And anything for you is anything for me
It's a love thing, baby
