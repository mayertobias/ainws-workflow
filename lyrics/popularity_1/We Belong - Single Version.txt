For peace no-one is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling
Everybody smoke
Use the pill and the dope
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule

He says don't worry
But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's hell below
We're all gonna go

Everybody's praying
And everybody's saying
But when come time to do
Everybody's laying
Just talking about don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worry
