9 ContributorsWhere Did the Angels Go Lyrics
Every day, I wake up and I fall from grace
Every move I make has got me stuck in the darkest place
I'd pray for mercy, but I love the fear
I should've listened while the angels were living here

I’m sick to my soul
I gave you control
It feels I'm hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe
That there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go?

Every day, I ask myself if this is real
And I only hurt myself to show you that I can feel
Are you the cancer that I can't survive?
I should've listened when the angels were still alive

I’m sick to my soul
I gave you control
It feels I'm hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe
That there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
I don't want to be the last to know
Maybe I should breathe and let it go
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go?

My demons are stronger than ever
This lifetime is harder than ever
It feels like forever
I'd become somebody better, somebody better

I’m sick to my soul
I gave you control
It feels I'm hanging at the end of my rope
I wanna believe
That there is still hope
Now I’m hanging in the balance alone
I don't want to be the last to know
Maybe I should breathe and let it go
Heaven better tell me where the hell did the angels go?

Where did the angels go?
Where did the angels go?
