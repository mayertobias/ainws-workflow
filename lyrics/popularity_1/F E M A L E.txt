I just landed in another atmosphere
I'm just floating, in a stain steel sphere
I bet you have questions like, "Where did I come from?"

I do not want you to go, but I don't know how to stop you

Whatever, whatever I guess whatever
I don't care, get dressed whatever
I don't feel like talking, whatever

Cause it's really out of my control
How you feel is not my problem
I really don't want you to go, but I do not want to stop you

'Cause you gon' do what you got to do
And what I do is not your problem
Just let me, let me love you
Stop trying to make it complicated

Really out of my control
What I do is not your problem
I really want to go
But please, please don't stop me
