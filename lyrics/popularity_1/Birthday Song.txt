Ah, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh?
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy, huh?
She holdin' out, she ain't givin' to the needy, huh?
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Y'all been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
'Specially if you put that BMW in a garage
'Specially if you paid a couple payments on her momma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man, I hate those kids
Last birthday, she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her "Do better"
She said, "How 'bout I get you jewelry from the West End?"
How 'bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend?
Ha, I'm jokin', I'm just serious, I asked her
"Don't be actin', like no actress, if we preachin', then we practice
Don't be reachin', don't be touchin' shit, we in Kanye West's Benz
'Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian, hah"

They ask me what I do and who I do it for (Yeah)
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio (Yeah)

You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your workplace
Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
What I'm seein’ from the back, I can't front on
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it, girl, get it, girl, get it, get it, girl
I might switch it up and get your girl
