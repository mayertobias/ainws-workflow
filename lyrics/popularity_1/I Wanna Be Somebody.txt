7 ContributorsI Wanna Be Somebody Lyrics
You say you don't wanna run and hide, a face that no-one knows
And everyone you meet, you're gonna show
You're nobody's slave, nobody's chains are holdin' you
You hold your fist up high and rule the zoo

Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody
To cry out

I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too

You say you don't wanna starve or take the table crumbs that fall
You don't wanna beg or plead at all
You don't want no nine-to-five, your fingers to the bone
You don't want the rock piles' bloody stones

Oh, you just got to be
Up high where the whole world's watchin' me
Cause I, I got the guts to be somebody
To cry out

I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too

I want shiny cars and dirty money, lotsa rock and roll
I will live in fame and die in flames, I'm never gettin' old


I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too
I wanna be somebody, be somebody soon
I wanna be somebody, be somebody too

I'm gonna be somebody, I'm gonna be somebody
