The song… Read More Mirror in the bathroom, please talk free
The door is locked, just you and me
Can I take you to a restaurant that's got glass tables?
You can watch yourself while you are eating
Mirror in the bathroom, I just can't stop it
Every Saturday, you see me window shopping
Find no interest in the racks and shelves
Just ten thousand reflections of my own sweet self
Self, self, self, self
Mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
You're my mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom, recompense
For all my crimes of self-defense
Cures you whisper make no sense
Drift gently into mental illness
Mirror in the bathroom, please talk free
The door is locked, just you and me
Can I take you to a restaurant that's got glass tables?
You can watch yourself while you are eating

Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
Mirror in the bathroom
