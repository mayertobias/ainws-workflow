I been workin' so hard
I'm punchin' my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got

Well, I got this feeling
That time's just holdin' me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight, I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

You're playin' so cool
Obeyin' every rule
But dig way down in your heart
You're burnin', yearnin' for some

Somebody to tell you
Life ain't passin' you by
I'm tryin' to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-ee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
Come on, come on, let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh
(Cut footloose, ah)
(First) You've got to turn it around
(Second) And put your feet on the ground
(Third) Now take ahold of your soul

I'm turnin' it loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back
Come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose

(Footloose)
Footloose (Footloose)
Kick off your Sunday shoes (Kick 'em on off)
Please, Louise
Pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back (Get on back, Jack)
Come on before we crack (Come on before we)
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
(Everybody)
Everybody cut footloose
