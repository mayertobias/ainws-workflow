Shorty, I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real, girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nothing make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothing
You made a brother feel like he was somethin'
That's why I'm with you to this day, boo, no frontin'
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say, "Baby, it'll be okay"
Now that's real to a brother like me, baby
Never ever give my cootie away and keep it tight, a'ight?
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life, you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin' in the effin' lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk with me
But you did, now I'm going all out, kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

You're all I need
To get by, by (All I need)

And it was plain to see

No need to shop around, you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up north, you in the world
Rockin' three-fourths of cloth, never showin' your stuff off, boo
It be true, me for you, that's how it is
