6 ContributorsYou Don’t Know About Me Lyrics
You don’t know what you talk about
It’s all lies that come out your mouth
Cause I wake up
This is my body, this is my war
We can’t wait ‘till you come around

Say what you’re gonna say
I don’t care anyway

You don’t know about me
You don’t know how hard I try
You don’t know about me
Why the hell should you decide?
You don’t know about everything going on inside
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me

You know I don’t care what you think
I get high, don’t say anything
Cause I wake up
This is my body, this is my war
Can’t we try to change everything

Say what you’re gonna say
I don’t care anyway

You don’t know about me
You don’t know how hard I try
You don’t know about me
Why the hell should you decide?
You don’t know about everything going on inside
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me

You don’t know about me

You don’t know about me
You don’t know how hard I try
You don’t know about me
Why the hell should you decide?
You don’t know about everything going on inside
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me
You don’t know about me
