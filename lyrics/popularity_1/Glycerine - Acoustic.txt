Must be for real 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind
It's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything's gone white
And everything's grey
Now you're here now you're away
I don't want this
Remember that
I'll never forget where you're at
Don't let the days go by
Glycerin
Glycerin
I'm never alone
I'm alone all the time
Are you at one
Or do you lie
We live in a wheel
Where everyone steals
But when we rise it's like strawberry fields
If I treated you bad
You bruise my face
Couldn't love you more
You got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could have been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
Should I have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Glycerin
Glycerin
Don't let the days go by
Glycerin
Don't let the days go by
Glycerin, glycerin
Glycerin, glycerin
Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
And she falls around me
I needed you more
You wanted us less
I could not kiss just regress
It might just be
Clear simple and plain
That's just fine
That's just one of my names
Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you
