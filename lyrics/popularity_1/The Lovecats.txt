We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

Into the sea, you and me
All these years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
"We missed you," hissed the love cats
"We missed you," hissed the love cats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire and sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream

Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
"We missed you," hissed the love cats
"We missed you," hissed the love cats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to dinner
We should have each other with cream
Then curl up in the fire, get up for awhile
It's the grooviest thing, it's the perfect dream

Hand in hand is the only way to land
And always the right way 'round
Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?

"We missed you," hissed the love cats
We missed
I love you, let's go
Oh, solid gold
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this?
