Can I scream? Yeah!
We lack the motion
To move to the new beat
Whoo! We lack the motion
To move to the new beat

It's here for us to admire
Can afford the beauty of it
Can afford the luxury of turning our heads
If we can (If we can, if we can, if we can)
Adjust that thousand-dollar smile
And behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings!

Whoo! We lack the motion
To move to the new beat
Yeah! We lack motion

When the day's over (Hey!)
The doors are locked on us
Money buys the access
And we can't pay the cost
How can we expect anyone to listen
If we're using the same old voice
We need new noise
New art for the real people!

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading!
We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs

We're not, we're not..
We're not, we're not..
We're not, we're not.. leading!

We dance, all the wrong songs
We enjoy, all the wrong moves
We dance, all the wrong songs
We dance, all the wrong songs
We enjoy, all the wrong moves
We dance, all the wrong songs

Crawling, slithering
Along the edge
Of a straight razor
And surviving

Here we go!

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
The new beat! The new beat!
Thank you.
