8 ContributorsHands Dirty Lyrics
I could raise the crops from the earth
I could raise my children from birth
But when I'm looking for work
They say that job ain't for her
I could be a good man's wife
I could give a new child life
But when I fight for my rights
They say no woman no cry

But I ain't giving up
I can't count on luck

I get my hands dirty
I show up so early
They show me no mercy
So I just keep working
Maybe God could save me
Or my boss might pay me
Right now no one serves me
Maybe their hands are dirty, dirty, dirty

I could lead impossible missions
Occupy the highest positions
But when I ask them to listen
They disregard my opinion
Well I ain't asking no more
I will command the floor
I'm breaking every glass ceiling
I'm building sky scraping buildings

And when that next storm comes
I'll do what I've always done

I get my hands dirty
I show up so early
They show me no mercy
So I just keep working
Maybe God could save me
Or my boss might pay me
Am I so unworthy?
Or are their hands just dirty, dirty, dirty?

And I have seen the other side of the mountain
Where every queen will be afforded her throne
And I will stand beside my sisters
And all persistent resistors
They'll say I knew it would come true
And I'll say 'darling, "me too"

I get my hands dirty
I show up so early
They show me no mercy
So I just keep working
Maybe God could save me
Or my boss might pay me
Right now no one serves me
Maybe their hands are dirty

I get my hands dirty
I show up so early
They show me no mercy
So I just keep working
Maybe God could save me
Or my boss might pay me
Am I so unworthy?
Or are their hands just dirty, dirty, dirty?
