17 ContributorsSweet Disaster Lyrics
Drifting like it's 1974
Dressing like the Rolling Stones
Hey, ho! Let's go, get some more
Like young Ramones

Some nights feel like every night
This one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind
When I'm with you

And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

Dreaming like it's 1984
Dancing like the Talking Heads
Last-call 40's at the corner store
To take to bed
Tell me that you need me on the floor
Passed out in your dirty clothes
Ask me what the hell I'm looking for
Like you don't know?

You're making it so easy
To throw myself away

And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Some nights feel like every night
This one feels brand new
Only got bad things on my mind
When I'm with you

And so it goes, we found our sweet disaster
In a river of champagne
Swimming through the morning after
We float away

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sweet disaster
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
