She knows me, nah really she knows
We was kicking it before I kicked flows
She was listen before the lit shows
Back when I could barely fit clothes
Little fitted hat, Nike socks with a hole
So broke couldn't even afford to split a pole
Got to move a little different when you got a lot of soul
'Cause the world will snatch you up & it'll never let you go
But her? She got to me first
and getting got is a feeling I got to disperse
Real love, knowing yourself, & knowing your worth.
& knowing she ain't only with you 'cause you filling her purse.
you feel me? Feel like god cursed and killed me
brought me back, broke me down, sent her to build me.
With allure she reeled me.
I matured but lil mama I'm still me

Lately I've been feeling loved
Touched & never back to earth
I'm floatin' I'm high
Words cannot describe
My passion for you
And everything you do
You lit me on fire
I will not deny ya
My Love

I know myself & that's why I know that she knows me
I know she loves me even though she only shows me
She never said it, she don't know she in love
On her face embedded I read it i knew what it was
A deep feeling that's deeply in need of healing
She need it so I was feeding Benadryl & penicillin to assist.
Not a doctor so I'm patient with this
remedy & she my patient so we taking a risk
Taking a break don't exist, listen I need a miss
That I can build with before i put some ice on her wrist
That I can build before I put that ice on her fist
before I do & a kiss, we overdue for some bliss
We need love
We need trust
Not a lot of needs only need us
Not a lot of needs only need you
She needs me & I know that you do
Keep it true

Lately I've been feeling loved
Touched & never back to earth
I'm floatin' I'm high
Words cannot describe
My passion for you
And everything you do
You lit me on fire
I will not deny ya
My Love
