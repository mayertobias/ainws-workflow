All day, I was out
Falling, thinking 'bout you
Buzzing by myself at night
You, you
Same place, same old rhyme
Same troubles on my mind too
I still chase and don't know why
Forever and ever, you'd never believe

For better or worse, this is all just a dream
Whenever the pressure got you on your knees
Just take it or leave it as long as you're free

Cut me loose, puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Halleluja, baby, now, baby, now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

One day, I realized
I'm never satisfied, I'm too
Drunk on this lullaby
Forever and ever, we'd never approve

Why everyone's ending; it's always too soon
Remember whenever you're black and you're blue
Don't fake it to feel it, whatever you do

Cut me loose, puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Halleluja, baby, now, baby, now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums

Going, going off the deep end
Reaching, preaching out to my friends
Hoping, hoping I see you again

Cut me loose, puttin' my, puttin' my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Alleluja, baby, now, baby, now stand up
Make your move to the beat of my, beat of my drum

To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drums
