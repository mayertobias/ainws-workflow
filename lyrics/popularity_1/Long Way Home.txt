We're taking the long way home (Taking the long way home)

Take me back to the middle of nowhere
Back to the place only you and I share
Remember all the memories?
The fireflies and make-believe
Kicking back in the old school yard
Singing songs on our guitars
This is our reality
Crazy stupid, you and me

We know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home (Taking the long way—)
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you
Talking 'bout nothing, yeah, whatever, baby
So we're taking the long way home (Taking the long way—) tonight

Ooh-ooh
We're taking the long way home
Ooh-ooh
(We're taking the long way home)
Taking the long way home

Now we're stuck in the middle of nowhere
Yeah, you know we took our time to get there
We're hiding out in a dream
Catching fire like kerosene (Kerosene)
And you know I'd never let you down
Till the sun comes up, we can own this town
Something like make-believe
Living in a movie scene

We know this is the way it's supposed to be

So we're taking the long way home (Taking the long way—)
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone
I wanna get lost and drive forever with you
Talking 'bout nothing, yeah, whatever, baby
So we're taking the long way home (Taking the long way—)

Hittin' every red light
Kissin' at the stop signs, darlin'
Green Day's on the radio
And everything is alright (Alright)
Now we're turnin' off the headlights, darlin'
We're just taking it slow

So we're taking the long way home
'Cause I don't wanna be wasting my time alone

I wanna get lost and drive forever with you
Talking 'bout nothing, yeah, whatever, baby
So we're taking the long way home

Hittin' every red light (Red light)
Kissin' at the stop signs, darlin'
Green Day's on the radio (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And everything is alright (Alright)
Now we're turnin' off the headlights, darlin'
We're just taking it slow

We're taking the long way home (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're taking the long way home (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
We're taking the long way home
