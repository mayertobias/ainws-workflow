16 ContributorsHollis to Hollywood Lyrics
Yeah, you know it be buggin' me out, yknahmsayin in rap
How everybody like is usin' metaphors and all that
It seems like everybody's like a.. like some kind of metaphor freak
Some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin' man
Yknahmsayin, word up, so, yknowhatI'msayin'
You know brother's wanna make a movie and all that
Yknahmean? So I figured yknowhatI'msayin'
I'd just make a little movie, witcha chick involved
Hehe, y'dig? Check it

If you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know
The way I stack chips and regulate wild dough
But ain't no G-Funk and far from my era
Tales in the hood your boys'll feel terror
MCs contaminating tracks with feces
You think I'm pussy until I flip like Species
High-tech, yep, my pen got velocity
Jumping out the SSL like Virtuosity
And never question what I'm doing to your girl
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld
But are metaphors the only thing in rap?
You brothers need to stop with that
I'm going from

Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
(See how it sounds? A little unrational)
(Broken down to his very last compound)
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
(See how it sounds? A little unrational)
(Broken down to his very last compound)
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
(See how it sounds? A little unrational)
(Broken down to his very last compound)
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?

I'll make the speed like I'm Keanu Reeves
But too many true lies can make a honey bleed
She said, I know you want this, ghetto Pocahontas
I got higher learning and banging gets monotonous
Her ass was classic, cheeks was Jurassic
Serving her justice, poetic the way I lasted
I touch ground real witty with my lyrics
Make her talk in tongue and feel the Holy Spirit
Hear it, pull it like strings, got mad cats to swing
When I do my thing, my balls are hairy like The Lion King
I'm in the jungle laying down my Mack
You brothers need to chill with that
I'm going from

Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?

(Take me away) Uh, you think I won't boo?
(Take me away) Uh, you think I can't boo?
(Take me away) Uh, you think I won't boo?
(Take me away) Uh, you think I can't boo?

It's kinda like miniature satellites floating in closets
Spying in pockets
Jumping out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!! Ha-ha-ha!
Yknahmean? Worrrrd up!
(Broken down to his very last compound) Uh

So your man got a good job loving you so much
Boss on his back coming home like "What the fuck?"
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin
That's when LL come in
Blast her ass like Apollo 13, sugar dipped in cream
Popping Dom in every direction, what a scene
He can't understand your best friend's plan
Running game while you chill with the demolition man
Good love, mad fun, tight hugs and flowers
I have your girl running off to fake baby showers
Better get down for your crown at home
I got her standing on the bed, getting closer to the drop zone
Some brothers won't appreciate that
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack? Let's run it back
See the flavor's in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me
Balls are lethal weapons, dick a menace to society
You ain't a playa hater, kid, you took her off restriction
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction
Kid you know I'm game tight
When you hit it tonight I hope she scream my name right
That's word is bond, kid... you know why?
I'm going from

Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good?
