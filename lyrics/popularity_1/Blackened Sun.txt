3 ContributorsBlackened Sun LyricsDying for a way out
Of this life in the pits of Hell
No light to chase and no god to praise
A cycle of pain to suffer in disgrace
Life is prison when you’re losing hope
And you’re the falling weight no one dares to hold
In this world I’ve found nothing but lies
Born a blackened sun and never meant to shine
Now I’m going nowhere fast
NOTHING REMAINS
Nothing to gain
NOTHING REMAINS
Hatred prevails
There ain’t no peace alone
When you’re caught with the rope around your throat
Agony is pulling and pulling me down
How deep can I go in this blood soiled ground
Born in affliction, seek no redemption
Broken inside without a CHANCE TO RISE
Stepped in the fire, left aside and abandonned
Unleash the lions, I guess I’m ready to die
Trapped in a cage where no one survives
Piling the bodies till I lose my mind
Misery loves me in my desperate times and still
I’m going nowhere fast

NOTHING REMAINS
Nothing to gain
NOTHING REMAINS
Hatred prevails
CAN’T STOP, can’t stop the pain
It doesn’t even matter if you fight or you quit
Can’t stop the pain
All that we love ends buried and lifeless…
