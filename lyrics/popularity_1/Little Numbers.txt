24 ContributorsLittle Numbers LyricsBecame most famous song by BOY being played in different TV spots of “Lufthansa”.
I'm waiting for your call and for the moon
To release me from the longest afternoon
I've rearranged parts of my living room
But time is hard to kill since I met you
I'm looking at the cars that drive on by
While spring is making promises outside
Red cars are quite rare, I realize
And then I wonder which color you would like

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart and

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I watch the sky change to a darker blue
I can't think of another thing to do
And every song just makes me think of you
Because the singer sounds as if she was longing
As if she was longing, too

Seven little numbers, baby, they could be a start
Seven little numbers, baby, I know yours by heart
And seven little numbers, baby, they could make a change
Seven little numbers make a fire out of this flame

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all?
For me at all, tell me
I read your name on every wall
On every wall, tell me
Is there a cure for me at all, for me at all?

Whoa-oh, all the pretty things that we could be
Whoa-oh, I feel you in every heartbeat
Whoa-oh, I revel in a dream that could come true
These numbers could be lucky for you

These numbers could be lucky for you
These numbers could be lucky for you
