1 ContributorLost the Feeling Lyrics
We rise with the sun
And fall with the moon
Your plans have 
And days end too soon
Somewhere we went wrong
Our spirits lost
We kept holding on with our fingers

Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh lost the feeling
(Lost the feeling)
(Lost the feeling)

Emotions run high
The lights dim low
I see in your eyes
A fire below
When you were a child
You were so sincere
Now her fake plastic smile
Runs from into it

Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Oh, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling

Where have the good times gone?
Where have the good times gone?
Where have the good times gone?
Where have the good times gone?

These streets are gold
Their hearts are black
My blood runs cold
There’s no turning back
The silence, it screams
It’s hard to ignore
I pull the trigger it seems

Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Oh, oh, oh lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling
Whoa, oh, oh, lost the feeling, oh
