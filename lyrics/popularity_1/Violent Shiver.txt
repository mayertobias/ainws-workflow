7 ContributorsViolent Shiver LyricsWhere I'm going, I'll go in
Where I'm going, I never know
Into the fire, half heart, you appoint me lover
With a cord around your neck can I ever love her?
Try your best to just stay sane
I try to placate with no shame
(Ooh) Ooh
Exhale out, breathe in, mark return to sender
Fucking up on a five year bender
I can only trust, only believe
That our pleas will be the same
(Ooh) Ooh
We found a way
We found a way
We found a way, a way
We found a way
Always should
A way
What she's knowing, I'm knowing
What she's knowing, I'll never know

Tearing it up, go now, across the mighty river
All the way to your father's pillar
Make a mark for me in the stone
Where the weeds have overgrown
(Ooh) Ooh
Let's go down, no talk, with a violent shiver
Attack first, you always deliver
If I go down with a gun to my head
Just remember what I said
(Ooh) Ooh
We found a way
We found a way
We found a way, a way
We found a way
