Standing lit by the candle light and make the moon my home
Tie up the tides as they rising, as they fall
What can I get? What can I hold?
Should I even ask these things at all?!

Though I live by candle light and only if I’d know
I’m walking down this road alone
We watch the Earth for a good will unfold
Until I find my golden home

I left a world of dreams and entered one anew
A planetary truth is born of lightning
There’s nothing left when you suffocate the hours
Spent beyond what time you had to offer

Though I live by candle light and only if I’d know (Show what you say and what you know)
I’m walking down this road alone ('Cause I find my golden home)
We watch the Earth for a good will unfold (Why don't you say what you know?)
Until I find my golden home ('Cause I find my golden home)

As it goes making up, it’s mine down into my bones
Isn’t this what you brought me here for?
This parallel of backwards gifts slips into my eyes
Isn’t this what I felt the need for?

Oh, child, you keep living that way in your own time
Oh, child, you keep living that way in your own time

This feeling back up circles and this loop through which I’m thrown
The moon will never keep us from unfolding
I point my way back home until my fingertips turn blue
There is no me and there is no you
