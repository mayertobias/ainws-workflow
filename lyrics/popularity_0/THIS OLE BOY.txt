This ole boy don't come from the city
This ole boy's got some rock 'n' roll roots
This ole boy still speaks Mississippi
This ole boy's got some miles on these boots
This ole boy done fell into something
I ain't talking 'bout mud or paint
Girl, you know I'ma gon' give it to you country
Couple things that ain't gonna change

That dog gon' hunt, this truck gon' ride
The river gon' run, the fish are gon' bite
Coyotes gonna howl at a full moon
This ole boy's gonna love you
You could take it to the bank, cash it on in
As long as that third rock from the sun spins
It's one of them things that's gonna stay true
This ole boy, this ole boy's gonna love you
Yes, he is

Yeah, this ole boy's whole life looks different
This ole boy's got a permanent grin
This ole boy's saying words like commitment
'Cause she's giving me some sugar with a lipper in

That dog gon' hunt, this truck gon' ride
The river gon' run, the fish are gon' bite
Coyote's gonna howl at a full moon
This ole boy's gonna love you
You could take it to the bank, cash it on in
As long as that third rock from the sun spins
It's one of them things that's gonna stay true
This ole boy, this ole boy's gonna love you
Yeah
This ole boy, this ole boy's gonna love you
Yeah

Smoke gon' blow, catfish gon' fry
That camp gon' flow on a Friday night

Yeah
That dog gon' hunt, this truck gon' ride
The river gon' run, the fish are gon' bite
Coyotes gonna howl at a full moon
This ole boy's gonna love you
You could take it to the bank, cash it on in
As long as that third rock from the sun spins
It's one of them things that's gonna stay true
This ole boy, this ole boy's gonna love you
This ole boy, this ole boy's gonna love you
This ole boy
