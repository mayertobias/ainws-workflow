I can see you comin' back for more
Comin' back for more, ayy
If you walk out that door

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, it all makes sense

If you walk out that door
I can see you comin' back for more (I can see you, *Ooh-ooh, ow*)
Comin' back for more (*Got me back for more, ah*)
If you walk out that door (*Come on*; Door, oh)

When I'm with you, it all feels different
When I'm with you, when I'm with you (No)
I can see you comin' back for more (Oh, oh)
Comin' back for more
If you walk out that—
