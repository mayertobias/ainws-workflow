I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head and into your arms tonight
Tonight (Yeah)

I don't mean to make you wait, just the pressure's been gettin' heavy
I know if I fuck us up, we'll be over, done, you'll forget me
Forget me, I'm feelin' bad that I act this way 'cause you let me
They call me king, but I know my queen will be there to check me
Last year, was runnin' 'round 45th lookin' for SoHo
Last night, was ridin' down Rodeo lookin' for NoHo
It's crazy what can change in a year, think that you know though
Go back and forth like a yo-yo, they live their life for the photos
And see, me, I'm actin' solo 'cause I'm afraid to commit
Now can you tell me how I'm different than him, and him, and him? Yeah
I know I'm always questionin' things
Like, "Girl, would you say that love cannot be found inside a vow or a ring?"
She laughs and says, "Only material things, those are material things
Imagine buyin' all my trust with a ring
Imagine spendin' all my love on a fling, got a thing for you
If I had the talent you had, I probably would sing for you," like

I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me
Out of my head and into your arms tonight
Tonight (Yeah)

I don't mean to make you wait, or to contemplate about us
My ex, she loved to lie, guess that's why it's harder to trust
I been searchin' to find myself and not get too lost in the lust
I heard once that you can try but can't fill from an empty cup
That's no lie, and all I ever say is how I need time
If it was up to you now, you would be mine
I'm on the road more than I'm home and still, I find it's only you on my mind
The last three were Gemini, I take that shit as a sign, it's funny
You can't buy time with your money
And you love goin' to the beach whether it's cloudy or sunny
And you love drinkin' all your wine until it hurts in your tummy
You call me, "Honey, I'm tipsy, and really all I want is for you to love me"
Flashbacks of back roads, drivin' back to my side of state
I know I need to tell you I care before it's too late
Before someone steps to the plate, before you decide not to wait
Before you decide not to chase, still you call me up just to say

I'm out of my head, out of my mind, oh, I
If you let me, I'll be
Out of my dress and into your arms tonight (Oh, baby)
Yeah, I'm lost without it
Feels like I'm always waitin'
I need you to come get me (Oh)
Out of my head and into your arms tonight
Tonight
