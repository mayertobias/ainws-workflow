1 ContributorDAGGER Lyrics(Ooh-yaa-ooh-yaa)
(Shit doesn’t matter)
(Jake Pl-Pl-Pl-Plus)
Shit doesn’t matter
I’m getting so high
I might just end up
On Saturn
Feeling a pattern
Your bitch on my dick
But you know
My bitch is badder
Carving a cavern
So I can go die
Bury me under the ice
So I can feel sadder
Putting me down
Stabbing my back
With a dagger
Ya
Making it hit
I be out running shit
Since a jit
I be out hitting licks
Just to fix
All of these feelings
Go numb when I mix
Booze with the sniff
Boss in the six
Bossing it up making
Moves with your bitch
Moving this bitch
Making her twerk
All of these feelings
I put them to work
Ya

I-I-If you hit my click
Then my click
Going to hate you
Ya that’s your bitch
But I think she love
My tattoos
Riding in the whip
I can’t fuck with
Your attitude
If you mess with me
On god that’s a bad move
Yea I pull up
And they pay me for it
I probably fucked her once
And I kind of got bored
So she hit my line
In her city on tour
And it don’t really matter
Make her mad some more
Ay
Shit doesn’t matter
I’m getting so high
I might just end up
On Saturn
Feeling a pattern
Your bitch on my dick
But you know
My bitch is badder
Carving a cavern
So I can go die
Bury me under the ice
So I can feel sadder
Putting me down
Stabbing my back
With a dagger
Ya

Making it hit
Running shit
Since a jit
Hitting licks just to fix
Feelings go numb
When I mix
Sniff
Boss in the six
Numb making moves
With your bitch
Bitch
Making her twerk
Feelings I put them to work
(Ya)
