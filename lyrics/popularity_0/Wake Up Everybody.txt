Wake up, everybody
No more sleepin' in bed
No more backward thinkin'
Time for thinkin' ahead
The world has changed so very much
From what it used to be
There is so much hatred
War and poverty
Woah, oh

Wake up all the teachers
Time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen
To whatcha have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's comin' up
And the world is in their hands
When you teach the children
Teach 'em the very best you can

Wake up all the doctors
Make the old people well
'Cause they're the ones who suffer
And who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long
Before their judgment day
So won't'cha make them happy
Before they pass away

Wake up all the builders
Time to build a new land
I know we can do it
If we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do
Is put it in our minds
Surely things will work out
They do it every time

The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, na, na, na, na, na, na
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah
Just you and me
