Tell the angels, "No"
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell 'em, "Bring me back to her""
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do if I can't be with you
The world could not go on, so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels came for me, I'd tell them, "No"

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Unthinkable
Me sittin' up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be movin' on (Movin' on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissin', touchin' her
Couldn't take nobody lovin' you the way we were
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me, I'd tell them, "No"

No (Yeah), I don't wanna leave my baby alone (My baby)
I don't want nobody else to hold you (Don't you do this to me)
That's a chance I'll take (If the angels come around, just tell 'em to bring me down to my baby)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth (Don't you do this to me)
I would tell 'em, "Bring me back to her" (Heaven can wait)
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

Oh no, can't be without my baby (I can't be without my baby)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy (You can't take her to me)
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting (See, if the angels come around, just tell 'em to bring me down to my baby)
Oh no, can't be without my baby (Hey, don't you do this to me)
Won't go, without her, I'd go crazy (I can't be without my baby)
Oh, no, guess Heaven will be waiting (Hey)
(I love you, girl, I need you, baby, I want you, baby)
No!

No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

I said no, just leave us alone
(You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so) Leave us alone
Please leave us alone (You're beautiful)
Please leave us alone, ah, leave me alone
Please leave me alone, I said, leave me alone
