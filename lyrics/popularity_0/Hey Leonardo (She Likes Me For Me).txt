She don't care about my car
And she don't care about my money
And that's real good 'cause I don't got a lot to spend
But if I did, it wouldn't mean nothing

She likes me for me
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford
With the charm of Robert Redford
Oozing out my ears
But what she sees
Are my faults and indecisions
My insecure conditions
And the tears upon the pillow that I shed

She don't care about my big screen
Or my collection of DVD's
Things like that just never mattered much to her
Plus she don't watch too much TV
And she don't care that I can fly her
To places she ain't never been
But if she really wants to go
I think deep down she knows that
All she has to say is when

She likes me for me
Not because I hang with Leonardo
Or that guy who played in "Fargo"
I think his name is Steve
She's the one for me
And I just can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
And I'm so glad I found her once again
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again (Come on)

Gazing at the ceiling
As we entertain our feelings in the dark
The things that we're afraid of
Are gonna show us what we're made of in the end

She likes me for me
Not because I sing like Pavarotti
Or because I'm such a hottie
I like her for her
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford
She has got so much to offer
Why does she waste all her time with me?
There must be something there that I don't see
I don't see

She likes me for me
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Harry
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey
Unlike the "Cable Guy"
But what she sees
Is that I can't live without her
My arms belong around her
And I'm so glad I found her once again
(She likes me for me)
Found her once again (She likes me for me)
Once again (She likes me for me)
Yeah, I'm so glad I found her once again
