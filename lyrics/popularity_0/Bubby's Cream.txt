'Cause you were in for the penny
And I was in for the pound
We split a fifth of that henny
I'm talking sober shit now
But then this isn't confession
Am I acting the child?
I'm saying prayers and hanging outcha
We haven't talked in a while
Well that's a lie I've been talking
You just didn't reply
You're just not that into it
But that won't satisfy
I've got to pick apart the 50 different ways that you hate me
All 'cause I got left on the shelf
But me and you were never more than a daydream..
Maybe I just hate myself

Nah fuck that
Cause all the signs were present
And all the looks checked out
And we'd been smitten since seven
I had the numbers to dial
Even acted the gentlemen
Kiss goodbye and a smile
Told me that you hadn't been in love in a while
So where did I mess up?
Did I come on too strong?
Was that an X too many?
Did we make love too long?
Did I write your name too many times
Throughout these songs?

I feel l'm fallin' at fault for these failures
I liked it better when we were strangers
You're not about to grip the bat until I make it to majors
There's no room at your inn
So for now can we fuck in the manger?
So for now can we fuck in the manger?
So for now let's fuck in the manger

I'm less of a wise man
More of a prodigal son
Follow anything that glitters
Spent my gold on a gun
Hold up the Grammys for gramophones
Hope Mam don't come
To see her son on the stage
I'm laying waste to the funds
That's been invested in me since
I smashed the skin of them drums
Or begged for MPCs
To beat my eardrums numb
Request those burnt CDs
Or cash to skin them blunts
And lie like late night walks were used to clear these lungs
*Hacktoo*

But if I made it on the telly would we work out?
And if I give up the deli and start to work out
If I finally start this essay and up the word count
Graduate with honours would you still think I'm a burn-out?
If I made it on the telly would we work out?
And if I give up the deli and start to work out
If I finally start this essay and up the word count
Graduate with honours would you still think I'm a burn out?

Who knows?
That’s how it goes right?
Who knows, is how it goes right
Who knows how this shit goes right?
Who knows?
That’s how it goes right?
Who knows, is how it goes right
Who knows how this shit goes right?
