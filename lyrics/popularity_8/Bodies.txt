Only thing matter right now is livin' right now and I can't spare no feelings
Quiet on set, but my aura loud, I navigate through hood shit and wisdom
The money all here, young man, fuck holdin' your hand, you'll die broke tryna play victim
The little ideas I told made people go rogue until God did me a big one

Reincarnated with love
My Gemini twin back, powerin' up
No more handshakes and hugs
The energy only circulate through us
Everybody must be judged
But this time, God only favorin' us
Twenty years in, still got that pen dedicated to bare our truth
The etiquette speak with a vigilant tongue, the predicate this time is "fuck you"
I'm carryin' heavier hearts right now, I can power lift with Olympians too
I'm carryin' various darts right now, I desert this bitch like Tiramisù
See, we goin' body for body, I hand you a body, I'm probably a better masseuse
I really don't bother nobody, but they run it by me if I got to clear out the room
You would not get the picture if I had to sit you for hours in front of the Louvre
You would not have a soul even if I had told you to stand next to Johnny and Q
Started with nothing but government cheese, but now I can seize the government too
Remember the food stamp color was tan and brown, but now the hunnid in blue
'Member I said "I'm the greatest" back when you debated the number one and number two?
Topic was always hilarious to me, you carried 'em to me, I brung out the— Christ
